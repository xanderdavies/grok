# Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting in Small Algorithmic Datasets

Basic replication of grokking as observed in Power et al.'s "Grokking: Generalization Beyond Overfitting on Small Algorithmic Datasets." Code adapted from [OpenAI's implementation](https://github.com/openai/grok); behavior replicated for the modular division task (mod 97) with 50/50 train/test split and AdamW optimizer.
